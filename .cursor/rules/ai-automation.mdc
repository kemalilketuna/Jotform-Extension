# AI & Automation Implementation

## Input Emulation
- **DOM Events**: Use DOM events (click, input, keydown) with proper dispatching
- **Element Selection**: Implement robust element selection (CSS selectors, XPath, AI-based recognition)
- **Action Queue System**: Build action queue system with timing, safety guards against infinite loops
- **Safety**: Add safeguards to prevent infinite loops or harmful actions

## AI Agent Decision Making
- **Explainable AI**: Implement explainable AI decisions with confidence scores
- **Fallback Strategies**: Provide fallback strategies for low-confidence scenarios
- **Decision Reasoning**: Log decision reasoning for debugging and transparency
- **Confidence Scores**: Use confidence scores for action recommendations

## User Interaction Guidelines
- **Always request user permission** before performing actions
- **Provide clear feedback** during automation
- **Allow interruption**: Users must be able to interrupt or modify automation sequences
- **Respect preferences**: Honor user preferences and site-specific settings

## Action Queue System
- Build systematic action queue with proper timing
- Implement safety guards against infinite loops
- Allow users to interrupt automation sequences
- Provide clear feedback on automation progress

## Element Selection Strategy
- CSS selectors as primary method
- XPath for complex targeting
- AI-based recognition for dynamic elements
- Robust fallback mechanisms

## Learning & Adaptation
- Store successful interaction patterns
- Learn from user corrections and feedback
- Adapt to site changes and updates
- Maintain privacy while improving performance

## Error Handling & Safety
- Implement graceful fallbacks when automation fails
- Validate DOM manipulation targets before action
- Implement rate limiting for automation actions
- Safety guards against harmful or destructive actions

## Permission & Feedback Requirements
- Always request permission before performing actions
- Provide clear feedback during automation
- Allow interruption of automation sequences
- Implement explainable AI decisions
