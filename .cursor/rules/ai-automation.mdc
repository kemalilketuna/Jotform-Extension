# AI & Automation Implementation

## Input Emulation
- **DOM Events**: Use DOM events (click, input, keydown) with proper event dispatching
- **Element Selection**: Implement robust element selection (CSS selectors, XPath, AI-based recognition)
- **Action Sequencing**: Build a queue system for action execution with proper timing
- **Safety**: Add safeguards to prevent infinite loops or harmful actions

## AI Agent Decision Making
- Implement explainable AI decisions for user transparency
- Use confidence scores for action recommendations
- Provide fallback strategies for low-confidence scenarios
- Log decision reasoning for debugging

## User Interaction Guidelines
- Always request permission before performing actions
- Provide clear feedback during automation
- Allow users to interrupt or modify automation sequences
- Respect user preferences and site-specific settings

## Learning & Adaptation
- Store successful interaction patterns
- Learn from user corrections and feedback
- Adapt to site changes and updates
- Maintain privacy while improving performance

## Error Handling
- Implement graceful fallbacks when automation fails
- Validate DOM manipulation targets
- Implement rate limiting for automation actions
