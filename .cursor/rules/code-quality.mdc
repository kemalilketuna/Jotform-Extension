# Code Quality Standards

## Code Documentation
- Comments should be concise and only used for complex code
- Avoid obvious comments that restate what the code does
- Focus comments on explaining why, not what
- Use JSDoc for public function documentation

## Testing Standards
- Unit tests for utility functions and AI logic
- Integration tests for browser extension APIs
- E2E tests for automation workflows
- Cross-browser testing setup

## Error Handling
- Comprehensive error boundaries in React components
- Graceful degradation when browser APIs are unavailable
- Logging system that respects user privacy
- User-friendly error messages in the popup

## Refactoring Policy
- **Proactive Refactoring**: Always refactor code during development when improvements are identified
- **Code Clarity**: Prioritize code readability and maintainability over quick implementations
- **Clean Architecture**: Continuously improve code structure rather than leaving technical debt
- **No Postponement**: Refactor immediately when needed - don't defer improvements for later

## Documentation Requirements
- JSDoc for all public functions
- README with setup and development instructions
- Architecture documentation for AI decision-making
- Browser compatibility matrix
